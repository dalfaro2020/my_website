# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.

```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```

What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about?

The variable types are characters and numericals. No missing values.

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
glimpse(drinks)
skimr::skim(drinks)

Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}

Comment on top 25 beer consuming countries:
The African countries Namibia and Gabon exhibit especially high beer consumptions given their colonial history: Namibia used to be a German colony in the 20th century, and Gabon a French one. Both countries have relatively small populations (around 2 million), and their life expectancies are also relatively low (around 65 years), which also means that older people who may consume less beer are not included in the sample size. 

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

drinks %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = wine_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wine_servings, y = fct_reorder(country,wine_servings))) +

Comment on top 25 wine consuming countries:
Andorra is a country that borders France, the highest wine consuming country, and has a population of only 77,000. Equatorial Guinea has a history of being under Portuguese and French rule which also explains its high wine consumption. 

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}

Comment on top 25 spirit consuming countries:
Grenada had a Liquor Licence Act passed in 1901 which allowed citizens to consume unlimited amounts of alcohol legally, and this has had a profound impact on the drinking culture in the country. Many locals are arguing that more regulation needs to be passed to improve the situation. Many of the countries in the top 25 are in the Caribbean which has a strong spirit culture centred around its rum manufacturing capabilities.

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).


> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

What we can infer from these plots is that alcohol consumption can easily be traced through cultural and historical factors. For example, Namibia used to be a German colony and hence consumes the most beer, France is largely where viticulture originated, and Grenada, the top spirit consumer, is in the Caribbean which has a history of spirit manufacturing. What is interesting is that very few countries are repeatedly seen in the top 25 of either beer, wine or spirits. What this shows is that once a country is high in one type of alcohol, it tends to consume very little of other types. 

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
skimr::skim(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

-   `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
-   `budget`: The movie's budget
-   `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
-   `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB
-   `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
-   `rating`: IMDB average rating

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

-   Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?
> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.
There are no missing values, but there are some duplicate entries. This is why we created the variable "unique_movies" to account for duplicates in analysing our data. 

-   Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order

    ```{r, Count of movies by genre}
    unique_movies <- movies %>% 
      distinct(title,genre,director,year,.keep_all = TRUE)
    movies_count_genre<-unique_movies %>% 
    group_by(genre) %>% 
      count(sort=TRUE)
      
      head(movies_count_genre)
    ```

Comment: Genres that cater to a wider crowd tend to have more demand and therefore more are produced (i.e. comedy and action films). Other genres such as crime, biography and drama tend to require more specific interests which cater to a smaller crowd and thus garner less demand.

-   Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many \$ did a movie make at the box office for each \$ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

    ```{r, Return on Budget}
    returns_movies <- unique_movies %>% 
      group_by(genre)%>%
      summarise(mean_gross = mean(gross),
                mean_budget = mean(budget)
                ) %>% 
      mutate(return_on_budget = (mean_gross-mean_budget)/mean_budget) %>% 
      arrange(-return_on_budget)
    head(returns_movies)
      
    ```
> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.
Comment: Musicals have the highest return on budget by far. This is because their mean budget tends to be very low compared to horror and fantasy movies which have very high mean budgets because they require both special effects and live actors. Musicals also tend to exhibit many elements that family films also have which lets them draw in a wider audience.

-   Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

    ```{r, Top 15 directors}
    top_directors<- unique_movies %>% 
      group_by(director) %>% 
      summarise(
                sum_gross=sum(gross),
                mean_gross = mean(gross),
                median_gross = median(gross),
                sd_gross = sd(gross)) %>% 
      arrange(desc(sum_gross))

    head(top_directors, 15)

    ```

Comment: Steven Spielberg has a much higher gross revenue than the other directors. This can be attributed to the fact that he directed many films which are part of bigger franchise: e.g. Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones and Jaws. James Cameron has a disproportionately high standard deviation as two of his films (Titanic and Avatar) have grossed much more revenue than his other films. 

-   Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed.

    ```{r, Ratings distribution}
    rating_distribution <- unique_movies %>% 
      group_by(genre) %>% 
      summarise(
                min_rating=min(rating),
                max_rating = max(rating),
                mean_rating = mean(rating),
                median_rating = median(rating),
                sd_rating = sd(rating)) 
     head(rating_distribution)



    Rating_histogram <- ggplot(unique_movies, aes(x = rating)) +
      geom_histogram()+
      theme_bw()+
      labs(title = "Rating Distribution",
        subtitle = "Bar Chart",
        x = "Rating",
        y = "Count"
      )

    Rating_histogram
    ```
> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.
There is less correlation between gross earnings and ratings for the comedy and horror genres because people often watch these types of films either to have a laugh or be scared regardless of the quality of the film or the plot. On the other hand, action and adventure films are more highly regarded based on the ratings they obtain as people watch these movies based on their perceived quality.
The count of film ratings appears to be normally distributed, but is skewed to the left as most movies tend to be within the 5-7.5 rating range. The reason for this skewness is because filmmakers would not produce films unless they expected them to produce a rating of at least 5. 

## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?

There is no strong positive relationship between gross earnings and Facebook likes. Having higher Facebook likes does not necessarily mean higher revenues as likes do not necessarily translate to people going out to spend money and watch the film. Nevertheless, the highest grossing films do tend to have quite a few Facebook likes as they are very popular. Our x-axis is Facebook likes and our y-axis is Gross Earnings because we are trying to test if Facebook likes is a good predictor of Gross Earnings. 

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.


```{r, gross_on_budget}

There is not a strong positive correlation between gross earnings and budget, until the budget surpasses 1 million. After this point, there begins to be a stronger positive correlation. The sample size of films with a budget of less than 1 million is also very small. There are quite a few films with high budgets which flop at the box office, which shows why the correlation is not that strong.


-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

On the other hand, action and adventure films are more highly regarded based on the ratings they obtain as people watch these movies based on their perceived quality. Biography films also exhibit an interesting dynamic: there is a positive correlation between earnings and ratings until a certain point where it seems the highest rated biography films have lower earnings than expected. Similarly interesting patterns can be found in mystery and sci-fi films which peak in their earnings in the middle of their ratings distribution. However, these trends can also be explained by the small dataset. 


# Returns of financial stocks

> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/).

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns.

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.

```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyquant)
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
glimpse(nyse)
skimr::skim(nyse)


```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}
unique_companies <- nyse %>% 
    distinct(symbol, name,ipo_year,.keep_all = TRUE)

#divide by sector
companies_per_sector <- unique_companies %>% 
  group_by(sector) %>% 
  count(sort=TRUE) 
  companies_per_sector  
```

```{r}
companies_per_sector_plot <- unique_companies %>% 
  group_by(sector) %>% 
  count(sort=TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = n, y = reorder(sector,n)))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_bw()+
      labs(title = "Number of companies per Sector",
        subtitle = "Bar Chart",
        x = "Number of Companies",
        y = NULL)

The NYSE contains many more traditional industries (e.g. banks and insurance companies) which is why Finance and Consumer Services companies make up the highest number in the dataset. Many Technology companies instead choose to list on the NASDAQ, which explains why there are proportionately fewer Tech companies in this dataset.
  
Next, let's choose the [Dow Jones Industrial Aveareg (DJIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add `SPY` which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). The following code

```{r, tickers_from_wikipedia}

djia_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"


#get tables that exist on URL
tables <- djia_url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia. 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
djia <- map(tables, . %>% 
               html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
               clean_names())


# constituents
table1 <- djia[[2]] %>% # the second table on the page contains the ticker symbols
  mutate(date_added = ymd(date_added),
         
         # if a stock is listed on NYSE, its symbol is, e.g., NYSE: MMM
         # We will get prices from yahoo finance which requires just the ticker
         
         # if symbol contains "NYSE*", the * being a wildcard
         # then we jsut drop the first 6 characters in that string
         ticker = ifelse(str_detect(symbol, "NYSE*"),
                          str_sub(symbol,7,11),
                          symbol)
         )

# we need a vector of strings with just the 30 tickers + SPY
tickers <- table1 %>% 
  select(ticker) %>% 
  pull() %>% # pull() gets them as a sting of characters
  c("SPY") # and lets us add SPY, the SP500 ETF

```

Now let us downlaod prices for all 30 DJIA consituents and the SPY ETF that tracks SP500 since January 1, 2020

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, # cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- tickers %>% 
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2000-01-01",
         to   = Sys.Date()) %>% # Sys.Date() returns today's price
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.

               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 
              

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

table_monthly_returns <- myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise(
                mean_monthly_returns = mean(monthly_returns),
                min_ret=min(monthly_returns),
                max_ret = max(monthly_returns),
                mean_ret = mean(monthly_returns),
                median_ret = median(monthly_returns),
                sd_ret = sd(monthly_returns))

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock price-weighted index composed of 30 of the most important publicly-traded companies in the United. Due to this measure, we can observe some companies which have a smaller weighting have a larger market capitalization value. An example being Honeywell, which has a 4.29% weighting has a market capitalization of $152 billion. On the other hand, Apple only has a weighting 2.78%, yet has a total market capitalization of $2.43 trillion.

Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks

```{r density_monthly_returns}

density_monthly_returns <- 
  ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly, aes(x = monthly_returns)) +
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(~symbol)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Monthly returns for each stock",
       subtitle="Density Plot",
       x = "Monthly Returns",
       y = "Density") + 
       NULL

```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.
Stocks such as AAPL, DOW and INTC have the largest standard deviations presented in the previous table. Given the nature of their cyclical businesses, they present higher levels of risk. Riskier companies tend to display more variability in terms of monthly returns and lower levels of kurtosis. Non-cyclical stocks such as PG, KO, JNJ tend to underperform cyclical stocks in a bull market, and will also show lower levels of kurtosis, as they perceive less extreme returns. These companies can be perceived as safer.

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
library(ggrepel)


risk_return_plot <- 
ggplot(table_monthly_returns, aes(x = sd_ret , y = mean_monthly_returns))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Relationship between monthly returns and standard deviation",
       subtitle="Scatter Plot",
       x = "Standard Deviation",
       y = "Monthly Returns") + 
       geom_text_repel(data = table_monthly_returns, aes(x = sd_ret , y = mean_monthly_returns, label = symbol))+
       NULL



risk_return_plot


##
```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.
The graphs display different stock returns and their respective standard deviations representing the Efficient-market hypothesis. The stock with the lowest standard deviation, being the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) displays similar returns to other stocks with much higher risk. This can be explained by the previous theory, as unsystematic risk is not prized with higher returns.
The relationship between stock returns and risk shows a very weak positive relationship. Excluding outliers such as AAPL and CRM, most stocks performance does not increase with risk. An example being JPM and CSCO stocks, which both have much more risk than stocks such as MCD PG, yet display similar returns.

# Is inflation transitory?

> You may find useful the material on [downloading economic data from the FRED](https://mfa2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/#data-from-the-federal-reserve-economic-data-with-tidyquant).

A recent study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claimed that the [Current Inflation Spike Is Just Transitory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-20/current-inflation-spike-is-just-transitory-new-bis-study-argues). As the article says,

> The surge in inflation seen across major economies is probably short lived because it's confined to just a few sectors of the economy, according to the Bank for International Settlements.

> New research by the BIS's Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Egon Zakrajsek and Dora Xia adds to one of the hottest debates in economics -- how long the current surge in consumer prices will last. Both Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and his euro-area counterpart Christine Lagarde have said the pickup is probably transitory, despite a snarled global supply chain and a spike in energy prices.

Comment: There is a strong positive correlation between inflation and treasury yields, but this changes in the 2000s with the global financial crisis in 2008 with very high treasury yields, but negative inflation. The global financial crisis caused the consumer sentiment at the time to go down drastically, but investors were still eager to buy the 10-year treasury bonds as they still had long-term faith in the economy and saw the bonds as a safe haven asset. The positive correlation can especially be seen for 2021 as both yields and inflation has recovered from deep-low levels during 2020. 
Moreover, we can observe the general trend of yields decreasing over time. After the 2008 financial crisis, we entered a period of quantitative easing which greatly decreased overall interest rates. 
For the 2020s period, the graph has a reduced range for the Y-variable “10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate”, and positive levels for X-variable “Inflation”. It is paramount to bear in mind that the 2020s period only have years 2020 and 2021 in data, while the rest of decades has 10-year full data. 

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpeg"), error = FALSE)
```

You dont have to worry about the blue-red backgound and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1.  To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh)
2.  You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
3.  Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Download CDC vaccination by county
cdc_url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
vaccinations <- vroom(cdc_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(fips != "UNK") # remove counties that have an unknown (UNK) FIPS code

# Download County Presidential Election Returns
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ
election2020_results <- vroom(here::here("data", "countypres_2000-2020.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(population_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # select the latest data, namely 2019
  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))
  
  

```

You may find counties that as of September 2021 have 0% vaccination; don't discard them immediately, try to find out why you have zeros!

Comment: There is a slight negative correlation between % voting for Trump and % of total people vaccinated. This makes sense as Trump’s policies were very COVID-sceptic and vaccine-sceptic, so the counties voting for him would exhibit the same tendencies. There are 77 counties below the line of best fit in the majority non-Trump vote. Out of these counties, 86% are non-white majority. In these counties, the general level of wealth is lower. For example, many of these counties are in Alabama and Mississippi whose GDP/capita are $41,000 and $35,000 respectively. The average GDP/capita in the US is $61,000 which shows that these countries are at least 33% below the average. This lower level of wealth means that in these counties, there is probably less access to good-quality education which is a key factor in getting vaccinated. Without these counties, we would observe on the graph a much stronger negative correlation between % voting for Trump and % of total people vaccinated. 

# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor). The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian.

The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.

```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL

Comment:
The CDU gained popularity in March of 2020 for its policies as the pandemic started. For example, in Spain and Peru, the governing party also gained popularity at the start of the pandemic. People believed that the government’s decisions about lockdowns and financial support were optimal which may explain the higher popularity. After Armin Laschet was elected chairman of the Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrat party in January, the CDU progressively lost popularity as he is seen to be an unfavourable candidate to replace Merkel and he is viewed by political critics as lacking empathy. 
The Social Democrats have taken the lead in the polls for the first time in 15 years. This is due to the unpopularity of the CDU and Germans now are very concerned with the level of indebtedness in the country. They want looser fiscal policy and taxes on the rich and wealthy which has attracted a lot of support among the German population.
