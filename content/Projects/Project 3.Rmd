# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}
skimr::skim(yrbss) # 1004 missing in weight
favstats(~weight, data = yrbss)

yrbss_new <- yrbss %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d > 2,"yes","no"))

favstats(weight~physical_3plus, data = yrbss_new)

ggplot(yrbss_new,aes(x = weight)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of weights",
       x = "Weight",
       y = "Count")


```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.
```{r}
ggplot(yrbss_new, aes(x = physically_active_7d, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~physically_active_7d)
```

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. RUse the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}
yrbss_new <- yrbss %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d > 2,"yes","no"))

yrbss_new %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(number_2 = count(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  mutate(sum_2 = sum(number_2),
         percent_2 = number_2/sum_2)
        


```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

```{r}

```

  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
ggplot(yrbss_new, aes (x = weight, y = physical_3plus))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Boxplot of weight and physical activities",
       x = "Weight",
       y = "Whether physically active for at least 3 days a week")
  NULL
```

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r, ci_using_formulas}
ci_formula <- yrbss_new %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight,na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_weight = sd(weight)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se_weight,
            weight_low = mean_weight - margin_of_error,
            weight_high = mean_weight + margin_of_error)

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

```{r, t_test_using_R}
# H0: mean weights are NO difference for those who exercise at least 3 times a week and those who don’t
# H1: mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss_new)
# From the p-value(which is extremely small) and the CI(which not contains 0), we have reason to reject the null hypotheses
```



## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss_new %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```



Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss_new %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

H0: The mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same
H1: The mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are different
###please add more comments here
Reject the H0.



You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
skimr::skim(movies)
```
```{r reproduce graph}

```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}
# Hypothesis test using R formula
movies_new <- movies %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton"))

t.test(rating ~ director, data = movies_new)

# Hypothesis test using 'infer'
obs_diff_movie <- movies_new %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

null_dist_movie <- movies_new %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

ggplot(data = null_dist_movie, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

null_dist_movie %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_movie, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_movie %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_movie, direction = "two_sided")
```


# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval
ci_formula_omega <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_salary_gender = mean(salary,na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_salary_gender = sd(salary),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_salary_gender = sd(salary)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical*se_salary_gender,
            salary_gender_low = mean_salary_gender - margin_of_error,
            salary_gender_high = mean_salary_gender + margin_of_error)
ci_formula_omega
```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

### there is difference. 

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_1}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
obs_diff_omega_1 <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

null_dist_omega_1 <- omega %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

ggplot(data = null_dist_omega_1, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

null_dist_omega_1 %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_omega_1, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_omega_1 %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_omega_1, direction = "two_sided")

```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough


## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  
```{r, hypothesis_testing_2}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 

t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
obs_diff_omega_2 <- omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

null_dist_omega_2 <- omega %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

ggplot(data = null_dist_omega_2, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

null_dist_omega_2 %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_omega_2, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_omega_2 %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_omega_2, direction = "two_sided")




```



## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
ggplot(omega,aes(x = experience, y = salary)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm,se = FALSE)+ 
  theme_bw()

```


## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences



# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?

Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)


recessions
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.



# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

library(dplyr)
library(R.utils)
library(readr)
library(ggtext)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)

tidy_GDP_data <- UN_GDP_data %>% 
  subset(select = -c(CountryID)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:50,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  mutate(value = value/1e9)

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")

tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services"] <- "Exports"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure"] <- "Government expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)"] <- "Household expenditure"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services"] <- "Imports"
tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName[tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName == "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)"] <- "GDP"

country_list_GDP_all <- subset(tidy_GDP_data, Country == "United States"|
                                 Country == "India"|
                                 Country == "Germany")

country_list_GDP <- subset(country_list_GDP_all, IndicatorName == "Gross capital formation" |
                             IndicatorName == "Exports" |
                             IndicatorName == "Government expenditure" |
                             IndicatorName == "Household expenditure" |
                             IndicatorName == "Imports") %>% 
  group_by(IndicatorName)

```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r country_list_GDP_plot, fig.height= 5, fig.width= 8}

country_list_GDP_plot <- 
  ggplot(country_list_GDP, aes(x = year, y = value, group=IndicatorName, colour=IndicatorName)) +
  geom_path(size = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~factor(country_list_GDP$Country, levels = unique(country_list_GDP$Country)))+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010)) +
  labs(title = "GDP components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       x = " ", y= "Billion US$",
       color='Components of GDP') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=20, face = "bold"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size= 15), 
        legend.title = element_text(size=15),
        legend.text = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text = element_text(size=13),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8)) +
     NULL

country_list_GDP_plot

```



Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

```{r}
GDP_breakdown <- country_list_GDP %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(`Net exports` = Exports - Imports,
         GDP = `Gross capital formation`+`Household expenditure`+`Government expenditure`+`Net exports`,
         `Government Expenditure` = `Government expenditure`/GDP,
         `Household Expenditure` = `Household expenditure`/GDP,
         `Gross Capital Formation` = `Gross capital formation`/GDP,
         `Net Exports` = `Net exports`/GDP) %>% 
  select(Country, year,GDP,`Government Expenditure`,`Household Expenditure`,`Gross Capital Formation`,`Net Exports`) 

```


> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r, % difference from calculated_GDP and GDP from the original data}

GDP_compare <- subset(country_list_GDP_all, IndicatorName == "GDP") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = IndicatorName, values_from = value) %>% 
  add_column(calculated_GDP = GDP_breakdown$GDP) %>% 
  mutate(difference = ((calculated_GDP-GDP)/calculated_GDP),
         difference = scales::percent(difference)) 

GDP_compare

```


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

>replicate the second plot

```{r GDP_breakdown_plot, fig.height= 4, fig.width= 8}
GDP_breakdown_data <- GDP_breakdown %>% 
  subset(select = -c(GDP)) %>% 
pivot_longer(cols = 3:6,
               names_to = "component",
               values_to = "proportion") 

GDP_breakdown_plot <-
  ggplot(GDP_breakdown_data, aes(x = year, y = proportion, group=component, colour=component)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~factor(GDP_breakdown_data$Country, levels = unique(GDP_breakdown_data$Country)))+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010)) +
  labs(title = "GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars",
       x = " ", y= "Proportion",
       color='Components of GDP') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=15, face = "bold"), 
        legend.title = element_text(size=15),
        legend.text = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text = element_text(size=13),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
