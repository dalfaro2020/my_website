# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
    tidyweather <- weather %>% 
      select(Year,Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec) %>% 
      pivot_longer(c(Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec),
                   names_to = "Month",
                   values_to = "delta")
tidyweather
```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```
Comment:
The graph shows clearly that as time has gone on, the number of weather anomalies has gone up drastically. This corroborates the claim that scientists have made on humans bringing about climate change and the effect of increased greenhouse gas emissions on our environment.


Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

#Your code goes here...

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~fct_reorder(Month,date)) # use fct_reorder to order by date instead of alphabet
```
Comment:
The graphs show a roughly similar trend in weather anomalies in each individual month. The effects of increasing temperature are slightly more pronounced in November and December. This may be because these months come at the heart of winter and therefore show a bit greater variation and more extreme values in the northern hemisphere.


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with transparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    x = "Delta",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```
Comment:
The density plot shows the trend of how the delta (monthly deviations) has progressively increased as time has gone on. This is what we expect as, in line with modern conceptions of climate change, the number of monthly temperature anomalies has gone up as humankind’s industrial output has increased. Between 1881-1920, we can see a negative delta. This could be explained by the massive volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 whose ash clouds were so significant that they blocked and reflected more than usual the Sun’s rays, thus reducing global temperatures. 

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  ## our code here:
  summarise(na.rm=TRUE,annual_average_delta=mean(delta)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly", 
    x = "Year",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta" )                         


```
Comment:
From the last graph, we saw how each period’s delta was either 0 or close to 0, until after the 1950s when human fossil fuel emissions increased. Here, we can observe across the whole period how the number of anomalies has consistently grown, especially since 1960. This is also consistent with our notion of global warming. 

## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  #na.omit() %>% 
  filter(interval %in% "2011-present") %>% 
  #group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta),
            sd_delta = sd(delta),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_delta = sd(delta)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_delta,
            delta_low = mean_delta - margin_of_error,
            delta_high = mean_delta + margin_of_error)

formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

library(infer)
set.seed(1234)
boot_delta <- comparison %>%
              filter(interval %in% "2011-present") %>%
              specify(response = delta) %>%
              generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
              calculate(stat = "mean")

bootstrapping_CI <- boot_delta %>% 
                    get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")

bootstrapping_CI

```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

By constructing a confidence interval using one sample, the data show us that there is a 95% chance that the true average annual data mean is contained in the confidence interval (CI) between 1.01 and 1.11. The CI previously mentioned was constructed using one sample (the data) for the northern hemisphere, allowing us to infer about temperature anomalies in that zone of the earth, but not for the entire planet. It is not possible to know with certainty where the true parameter of a mean lies with only one sample (in this case, data for the northern hemisphere). To address the sampling variability problem, bootstrapping may be useful. Repeatedly sampling with replacement via Bootstrapping (BTS) creates resamples (in this case 1,000) and finally calculates 1,000 mean statistics to calculate a new confidence interval. Using the BTS method, there is a 95% chance that the true average annual delta mean is between 1.02 and 1.11. An additional benefit of using BTS is that the data distribution will approach a normal one because of the Central Limit Theorem.

# Global warming and political views (GSS)

[A 2010 Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/10/27/wide-partisan-divide-over-global-warming/) asked 1,306 Americans, "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"


In this exercise we analyze whether there are any differences between the proportion of people who believe the earth is getting warmer and their political ideology. As usual, from the **survey sample data**, we will use the proportions to estimate values of *population parameters*. The file has 2253 observations on the following 2 variables:

- `party_or_ideology`: a factor (categorical) variable with levels Conservative Republican, Liberal Democrat, Mod/Cons Democrat, Mod/Lib Republican
- `response` : whether the respondent believes the earth is warming or not, or Don't know/ refuse to answer

```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}
global_warming_pew <- read_csv(here::here("data", "global_warming_pew.csv"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".


```{r, response table}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response)
```

We will be constructing three 95% confidence intervals to estimate population parameters, for the % who believe that **Earth is warming**, accoridng to their party or ideology. You can create the CIs using the formulas by hand, or use `prop.test()`-- just rememebr to exclude the Dont know / refuse to answer!

```{r, prop test}

global_warming_pew_new <- global_warming_pew %>% 
  filter(response != "Don't know / refuse to answer")

global_warming_pew_new

#Conservative Republican
count_warming_1 = 248
count_1 = 248+450
prop_test_1 <- prop.test(count_warming_1,count_1)
prop_test_1

#Liberal Democrat
count_warming_2 = 405
count_2 = 405+23
prop_test_2 <- prop.test(count_warming_2,count_2)
prop_test_2

# Mod
count_warming_3 = 563+135
count_3 = 563+158+135+135
prop_test_3 <- prop.test(count_warming_3,count_3)
prop_test_3

```


Does it appear that whether or not a respondent believes the earth is warming is independent of their party ideology? You may want to

Comment: 
It does not appear that whether a respondent believes the earth is warming is independent of their party ideology. As a general trend, we can see how Conservative Republicans tend to believe less in global warming than Liberal Democrats. This makes sense as the issue of climate change is something that has divided the Republican and Democrat parties in the US. Of course, however, this is not a binary distinction and there are a fair number of Republicans who believe the Earth is warming and similarly a fair number of Democrats who believe the Earth is not. 

# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero.

Comment:

We can observe how since he has come into office, Biden’s popularity has been steadily on the decline. This can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, the rise of the Delta variant has prolonged the return to normalcy in many American states. Secondly, Biden’s execution of the US military’s pullout from Afghanistan was viewed by many as badly mishandled. Both of these factors have meant that more US citizens now disapprove of rather than approve of him. 

## Compare Confidence Intervals:

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.
The confidence intervals for week 3 and 25 respectively show the steady decrease in Biden’s approval rating. This can be attributed to the factors described above: mainly (1) The rise of the Delta variant; and (2) The US pullout out of Afghanistan. 

# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))

bike
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?
As expected, the number of bikes hired per month very much depends on the season and the weather. For instance, in the months November, December, January, and February, the distribution of hikes hired per month tends to be relatively low. However, in summer months such as June, July, August, the average number of bikes hired per month is at its highest.

This is not exactly the same in 2020, especially in May and June, as the UK was still in lockdown and with many working from home, there were not as many people hiring bikes in these months. 

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`.

```{r, monthly data table for Tfl bike rentals}

monthly_data <- bike %>% 
                group_by(month, year) %>%

            mutate(up = ifelse(actual_rentals>expected_rentals, actual_rentals,expected_rentals),
            down = ifelse(actual_rentals<expected_rentals, actual_rentals,expected_rentals))

Comment:
Through this graph, we can see the strong seasonality in TfL bike rentals. The peak always comes in the summer and the rentals are always lowest around the turn of the year, i.e. in November, December, January and February. The above average demand for bikes in 2018 and 2020 can be explained by the following reasons: (1) 2018 was the UK's warmest summer since 2006 and the sunniest since 1995 which meant that more people were wanting to rent bikes than on average; and (2) Summer 2020 coincided with a release of lockdown which meant that many more people were willing to go out and rent bikes. 


```{r, weekly data table for Tfl bike rentals}

Comment: 
In these graphs, we can see a more granular view of changes in bike rentals. As seen in the graphs above, there is a lot of positive weekly changes in the summers of 2018, 2020 and 2021. However, with this data, we can see that the spike is much higher in 2020 and 2021 with the release of lockdown restrictions than in 2018 when people rented more bikes simply because the weather was better that summer. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?
We should use the mean to calculate our expected rentals because the mean is generally used for data sets which are more roughly normally distributed, whereas the median is good for datasets with many outliers. Although there are some outliers in our data, there are not enough to suggest using the median instead of the mean.

# Challenge 2: How has the CPI and its components changed over the last few years?

Remember how we used the tidyqant package to download CPI data. In this exercise, I would like you to do the following:

1. You can find [CPI components at  FRED](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843). You should adapt the code from German polls to scrape the FRED website and pull all of the CPI components into a vector. FIY, the list of components is the second table in that webpage.
1. Once you have a vector of components, you can then pass it to `tidyquant::tq_get(get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01")` to get all data since January 1, 2000
1. Since the data you download is an index with various starting dates, you need to calculate the yearly, or 12-month change. To do this you need to use the `lag` function, and specifically, `year_change = value/lag(value, 12) - 1`; this means you are comparing the current month's value with that 12 months ago lag(value, 12).
1. I want you to order components so the higher the yearly change, the earlier does that component appear.
1. You should also make sure that the **All Items** CPI (CPIAUCSL) appears first.
1. Add a `geom_smooth()` for each component to get a sense of the overall trend.
1 You may want to colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative. 

Having done this, you should get this graph.

```{r cpi_all_components_since_2016, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cpi_components_since_2016.png"), error = FALSE)
```

This graphs is fine, but perhaps has too many sub-categories. You can find the [relative importance of components in the Consumer Price Indexes: U.S. city average, December 2020](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm) here.

```{r, CPI yearly change}

library(R.utils)
library(readr)
library(ggtext)

CPI_data_1 <- read_csv(here::here("data","cpi_data.csv"))

CPI_data_1

start <- "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: "
end <- " in U.S. City Average"

for(i in 1:18783)
{
CPI_data_1[i,4] <- strsplit(strsplit(CPI_data_1$title[i], start)[[1]][2], end)[[1]][1]
}

  select(component,date,title,value,year) %>%   
  filter(year>2015) %>% 
  group_by(component) %>% 
  mutate(year_change = value/lag(value, 12) - 1)

CPI_data_2

CPI_data_3 <- CPI_data_2 %>% 
  group_by(date, component, year_change) %>% 
  summarize (date, component, title, year_change)

  na.omit()

                      arrange(desc(maximum)) %>%
                      arrange(factor(title, levels = c("All Items")))

        geom_point(color = ifelse(CPI_data_for_plot$year_change<0,"steelblue1","orangered")) +
        facet_wrap(~factor(CPI_data_for_plot$title, levels = unique(CPI_data_for_plot$title)), ncol=7,scales = "free")+
        geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "slategrey") +
        theme_bw()+
        scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
        labs(title = "Yearly change of US CPI (All Items) and its components",
        subtitle = "<span style = 'font-size:12pt'>YoY change being <span style = 'color: orangered;'>positive</span> and <span style = 'color:       steelblue1;'>negative</span><br>Jan 2016 to Aug 2021",
         x = " ",
         y= "YoY % change",
         caption = "Data from St. Louis Fed FRED

        theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), plot.subtitle = element_markdown( ), strip.text = element_text(size=10)) +

Can you choose a smaller subset of the components you have and only list the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel), sorted according to their relative importance?

```{r, CPI yearly change for major components}

library(dplyr)

subset_CPI <- subset(CPI_data_for_plot, title =="Housing" |
       title =="Transportation" |
       title =="Food and Beverages" |
       title =="Medical Care" |
       title =="Education and Communication" |
       title =="Recreation" |
       title =="Apparel") 

subset_CPI

major_components <- subset_CPI %>% 
                    arrange(factor(title, levels = c("Housing","Transportation", "Food and Beverages", "Medical Care","Education and Communication","Recreation","Apparel")))

major_components

major_category_plot<- ggplot(major_components, aes(x = date, y = year_change)) +
                      geom_point(color = ifelse(major_components$year_change<0,"steelblue1","orangered")) +
                      facet_wrap((~factor(major_components$title, levels = unique(major_components$title))), scales = "free")+
                      geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "slategrey") +
                      theme_bw()+
                      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
                      labs(title = "Yearly change of US CPI (All Items) and its components",
                      subtitle = "<span style = 'font-size:12pt'>YoY change being <span style = 'color: orangered;'>positive</span> and <span style = 'color:       steelblue1;'>negative</span><br>Jan 2016 to Aug 2021",
                      x = " ",
                      y= "YoY % change")+

Comment:
Given the current post-pandemic economy, many investors and businesses, in general, are very concerned with how inflation will impact the global economy. Although there is no consensus on how inflation will progress, some argue that the current uncontrolled inflation, that can be observed in most U.S. CPI components such as, Food and Beverages, Apparel and Medical Care which have yearly change considerably higher than in prior years is due to a mismatch in supply and demand caused by the global pandemic and the unexpected increase in demand, particularly from the United States.
 
The poor economic outlook during the start of the pandemic influenced many key manufacturing countries to under stock their inventories. This under stocking combined with an extraordinary increase in demand has depleted inventory stocks worldwide, increasing the price of many commodities and products. Once the supply cycle can catch up with the current level of demand, this mismatch will ease, and so could inflation, possibly without the need for Central Bank intervention.

On the other hand, components such as housing are still growing at a strong pace (c. 2.5%) due to low mortgage rates and rising wages, but at a slower pace compared to other components. This easing is due to the future economic uncertainty, and the increase in the supply of housing.

Can you choose a smaller subset of the components you have and only list the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel), sorted according to their relative importance?
